# ClubVantage Elevator Pitches

## For Investors

Club management is a $4B market stuck in the 90s—spreadsheets, manual billing, and angry members. ClubVantage is an AI-first ERP that automates 90% of club administration for golf, spa, fitness, and recreational facilities. We're targeting 15,000+ clubs across Southeast Asia with a vertical SaaS model: $300-$2,500/month per club. Our unfair advantage? Native Asia-Pacific compliance—withholding tax, multi-currency, and local payment rails that Western competitors can't match.

## For Club Operators

Your staff spends 20+ hours a week chasing invoices, fixing booking conflicts, and manually entering data. ClubVantage eliminates that. Members book tee times, spa treatments, tennis courts, and fitness classes—all from their phone. Your team gets real-time dashboards, automated billing, and zero double-bookings. One club manager told us: "We went from 3 billing clerks to 1." That's ClubVantage.

## For Technical Partners

ClubVantage is a multi-tenant Next.js/NestJS platform with PostgreSQL row-level security for data isolation. We run Llama 3.1 locally for privacy-first AI insights—member churn prediction, booking optimization, conversational support. Unified booking engine handles golf tee sheets, spa therapist scheduling, and facility reservations with triple-constraint validation. The architecture supports Thai addresses, WHT split receipts, and regional payment rails. We're looking for integration partners.
