# ClubVantage Video Script — Club Management & Executives

**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Tone:** Strategic, confident, ROI-focused
**Target Audience:** Club GMs, board members, owners, CFOs

---

## Scene 1: The Strategic Challenge (0:00–0:25)

**VISUAL:** Elegant club exterior at sunrise. Cut to boardroom—executives reviewing thick printed reports, concerned expressions. Charts showing declining retention, rising admin costs.

**VOICEOVER:**
"You didn't get into this business to chase spreadsheets. But every month, it's the same story—billing errors, member complaints, staff buried in admin work. Your best people are processing invoices instead of improving member experience. And you're flying blind on the metrics that matter."

---

## Scene 2: The ClubVantage Difference (0:25–0:45)

**VISUAL:** Modern executive dashboard on large screen—KPIs at a glance: MRR, retention rate, facility utilization, AR aging. GM reviewing on tablet while walking through club.

**VOICEOVER:**
"ClubVantage gives you command of your entire operation. Real-time dashboards show revenue, retention, and utilization across golf, spa, fitness, and every facility—all in one view. No more waiting for month-end reports. No more surprises."

---

## Scene 3: Financial Control (0:45–1:10)

**VISUAL:** Automated invoice being generated. AR aging buckets visualized (Current, 30, 60, 90+). Delinquent account auto-suspended from booking. GL sync to Xero/SAP.

**VOICEOVER:**
"Automated billing eliminates errors and accelerates collections. Members at 90+ days? Automatically suspended from bookings until they pay. Withholding tax handled. GL syncs daily to your accounting system. Your finance team finally has clean books—and time to analyze them."

---

## Scene 4: Member Retention & AI Insights (1:10–1:30)

**VISUAL:** AI panel highlighting "12 members at churn risk" with reasons. Manager clicking through to member profile. Automated re-engagement email being triggered.

**VOICEOVER:**
"Our AI doesn't just crunch numbers—it predicts who's about to leave and why. Booking frequency dropped? Payment delays? You'll know before they cancel. Intervene early. Keep your best members."

---

## Scene 5: Operational Efficiency (1:30–1:45)

**VISUAL:** Split screen—old way (staff on phone, paper calendar, frustrated member) vs. new way (member self-booking on app, staff greeting members warmly, empty back office).

**VOICEOVER:**
"Members book tee times, spa treatments, and courts themselves. Staff handle exceptions, not routine tasks. One club reduced billing headcount by 60%. That's margin back in your pocket."

---

## Scene 6: Built for Asia (1:45–1:52)

**VISUAL:** Flags of Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia. Payment icons (PromptPay, PayNow, DuitNow). Multi-currency invoices. Thai address formatting.

**VOICEOVER:**
"Purpose-built for Southeast Asia. Local taxes, payment rails, and compliance—handled."

---

## Scene 7: Call to Action (1:52–2:00)

**VISUAL:** ClubVantage logo. Executive shaking hands with ClubVantage rep. URL on screen.

**VOICEOVER:**
"ClubVantage. See your club clearly. Run it confidently. Schedule a executive briefing today."
