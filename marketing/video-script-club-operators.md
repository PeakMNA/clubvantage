**VISUAL:** Montage of frustrated staff—papers piling up, phone ringing, sticky notes everywhere, spreadsheet chaos on screen, member waiting impatiently at front desk.

**VOICEOVER:**
"Running a club shouldn't feel like this. Your team spends hours chasing invoices, juggling spreadsheets, and apologizing for double-booked tennis courts. Meanwhile, members just want to book a tee time without calling the front desk."

"Your members book tee times, spa treatments, courts, and classes—all from their phone. They pay dues, view statements, and check in with a QR code. No calls. No waiting."
